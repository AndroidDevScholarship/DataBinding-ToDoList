# DataBinding-ToDoList
A simple note taking app where I have started experimenting with data binding, using a SQL database

At the moment this is a very basic app with an EditText and a button to save notes in a RecyclerView.
The notes can also be deleted by simply clicking on them. Any contributions are ofcourse welcome since
the code can probably be very much improved.

* First of all I want to make the code as clean and effective as possible using the data binding concept. 
  I have made a few issues that you can check out if you want to contribute. If you find anything in the
  code that can be improved then feel free to raise an issue and make commits and pullrequests.
  
* This has been an experiment just to get started with the databinding concept so far but I hope that the
  project can evolve into a more advanced app. The app should have a very simple UI where one can quickly
  just type down any type of note that comes into mind. When you are on the move in your daily life I think
  this can be very valuable. I would like the app to also have the ability to share the notes that are saved.
  you should be able to easily export it into the calendar app or send it to someone via E-mail or text etc
